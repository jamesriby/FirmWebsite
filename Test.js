// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.
var myObject = {
	username : "jriby",
	password : "5178"
};

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".

var database = [myObject, ];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".

var newsfeed = [
	{
	username : "jriby",
	password : "5178"
	},
